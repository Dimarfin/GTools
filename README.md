# GTools
Gtools is a set of python functions for G-code processing and tweaking. 
G-code is a widely used language to controll CNC machines including 3D printers. Usualy it is generated by a CAD software and loaded into a device. 
However, there are cases when one needs to post-process G-code files or even create a new G-code file manualy. Such cases include ones related 
to research and developtment tasks when control of the printing parameter of every line is required. For example it is required for microscale printing 
(or simply printing at the limit of the printer resolution). The code presented in this repository was succefully use for manipulation G-code instructions for 
controlling a 3D-Bioprinter in TU Dresden in a project on 3D printing of soft and stretchable neuroinplants. The results of the project were published in several scientific papers:
